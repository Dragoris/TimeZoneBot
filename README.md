TimeZoneBot is a chat bot for a Slack channel that takes in a location and will return back the time at that location, a map of the loation, their timezone, and the time diffrence from your location to theirs. Since this bot is using the Google maps API it accepts locations in any format that Google Maps would accept, making it very flexable. 

This bot is hosted on Heroku and available for use in any Slack channel.
